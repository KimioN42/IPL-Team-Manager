# IPL-Team-Manager

Simple project written in JavaFX that allows a user to keep track of the main stats of an IPL Cricket Team.

## Description

The project allows user to create, edit and delete new players in the program, and it also keeps track of that data in the database.dat file. 
You can always come back to the program to see how much your favorite player has improved the stats since the last time you updated.
